Usage of Internet over the past 50 years with geospatial distribution

I have chosen 2 methods as main and rest of the bubble and scatter line were just for to give a
shot.This dataset covers internet usage over 40 years. This contains %internet usage per population
for each representing country. This is why I have started with chloropeth since it is a good
visualisation technique when it comes to geographical distribution.
Animation with chloropeth was a clear choice for this dataset. First I have read given csv file and
created a data frame.

First method, chloropeth;
1-Chloropleth Map:
A Chloropleth map is a geographical visualization technique that uses different shades or colors
to represent data values associated with specific regions. In our case, it's the internet usage per
population for different countries. Here's why a Chloropleth map is a good choice for hw2 data:
a. Geographic Distribution: Chloropleth maps are excellent for visualizing geographic
distributions and highlighting differences between regions. By using this technique, you can
easily identify countries with high or low internet usage.
b. Visual Comparison: The color-coding scheme makes it easy to compare internet usage levels
across countries, providing a clear overview of the data.
c. Intuitive Interpretation: Chloropleth maps are familiar and intuitive, making them easily
understandable by a wide range of audiences
